                    This is the first website I have ever made. My name is Charles Alders, but you can 
                    learn more about me in the About Me tab. The Projects tab will show you some of the 
                    work I have done for this class so far, and the Github tab
                    will take you to my repository that contains all of my work so far. Thank you!
