Here is my very basic client-side website. I just made this
about myself, with pages for the Home/Welcome, About Me, the
projects I've done in this class, and a page for my Github.

For the projects tab, I really wanted the screenshots to show
just like how I did the about page, but no matter what I tried, 
the images would not load, so I settled for Gyazo links. Sorry,
I know it looks bad, but it works!
